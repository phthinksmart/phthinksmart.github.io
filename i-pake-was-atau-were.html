◇Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry. Then she saw a little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs.The dwarfs said, “What is your name?”Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.The dwarfs said, “If you want, you may live here with us.”Snow White answered, “Oh, could I? Thank you.”Finally, Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.​</a>

The clever judge
Hello, friends! How is life today? I'm very well, thankyou. Well friends, have you ever heard the story of the " The Clever Judge ", that is the story of a fox and two donkeys? Okay, I am not sure. Maybe, most of us haven't heard the story of the clever judge from our parents or grand parents, well friends, now I would like to tell you about it. Listen to me. Once a lion, a fox, and a donkey set off for day's hunting, after agreeing that each was to have an equal share what was caught.
After a time, they were able to pull down an kill a fat buck, and the lion asked the donkey to be so good as to divide the prize. As fairly as he could, the obliging donkey cut up the buck into three equal parts, and then he invited the lion to take his choice. At this, the lion flew into a violent rage, sptang on the poor donkey and killed him with a powerful blow. Then the lion told the fox to divide the meat. This the fox did, but he was cunning. He put aside a big heap for the lion's share, and kept only a small piece for himself. On seeing this, the lion looked very pleased. " Master fox" he said, this is indeed a most satisfactory divisor. Who taught you to be so clever? ' The dead donkey has been my teacher' replied the fox. " From his foolish conduct I have learned to be wise "
Okay friends, I think that's all for now. And thank you very much for your attention. Goodbye</a>

Last month i did PSG . i took a practice at a clinic . i learned so many new thing. i learned about nursing science , how to interact well , maintain behavior and ethics.
daily habits change, such as injecting drugs, giving drugs, helping calm patients, and more
there is very much experience and learning that I got from there. and maybe I'll just tell you one experience.
I'm not afraid or disgusted with blood, vomiting, and feces. and when one day I was given permission to witness the hectic process in the head area.
I was dizzy, nauseous, my knees were limp I wanted to get out of the room but I quickly changed my mindset when I saw the hectic process.
I think all this is for learning, we should know because we are in the health sector.
and from there all the symptoms disappeared.

                                            The Legend of Surabaya    A long time ago in East Java there were two strong animals, Sura and Baya. Sura was a shark and Baya was a crocodile. They lived in the sea. Actually, they were friends. But when they were hungry, they were very greedy. They did not want to share their food. They would fight for it and never stop fighting until one of them gave up.    It was a very hot day. Sura and Baya were looking for some food. Suddenly, Baya saw a goat. “Yummy, this is my lunch,” said Baya. “No way! This is my lunch. You are greedy! I had not eaten for two days!” said Sura. ThenThen Sura and Baya fought again. After several hours, they were very tired. Sura had a plan to stop their bad behavior. “I’m tired of fighting, Baya,” said Sura. “Yes, I do. Let’s share our territory. I live in the water, so I look for food in the sea. And you live on the land, right? So, you look for the food also on the land. The border is the beach, so we will never meet again. Do you agree?” asked Sura. “Hmm... let me think about it. OK, I agree. From today, I will never go to the sea again. My place is on the land,” said Baya. ThenThen they both lived in the different places. But one day, Sura went to the land and looked for some food in the river. He was very hungry and there was not much food in the sea. Baya was very angry when he knew that Sura broke the promise. “Hey, what are you doing here? This is my place. Your place is in the sea!” “But, there is water in the river, right? So, this is also my place!” said Sura.     Then Sura and Baya fought again. They both hit each other. Sura bite Baya's tail. Baya did the same thing to Sura. He bit very hard until Sura finally gave up. He went back to the sea. Baya was very happy. He had his place again. TheThe place where they were fighting was a mess. Blood was everywhere. People then always talked about the fight between Sura and Baya. They then named the place of the fight as Surabaya, it’s from Sura the shark and Baya the crocodile. People also put their war as the symbol of Surabaya city.TOLONG RINGKAS CERITA DI ATAS,, PAKE BAHASA INGGRIS YHAA~!!! MAKASIH. /point gede loh/​</a>

IN THE OLDEN DAYS, when the tigers still lived in peace with other animals, the crow was called "The Bird of Paradise." Her feathers were of purest white; but since then she has lost these beautiful white feathers and in their place wears black ones. How this came about is told in a very old tale: When Allah had shaped the fishes, the birds, and the four-footed beasts, he called the white crow to him and said, "Bird of Paradise, you are large and handsome, you are strong and swift; therefore you shall be my messenger." The crow bowed her sleek white head and said, "Great Allah, I will be your messenger. Tell me what you wish me to do. Allah showed the white crow a bit of clay, and said, "From this clay I am going to knead a man." So Allah kneaded a man, and when he had laid the figure near him on the ground he called the animals to admire it. All of them came the birds, the four-footed beasts, and the fishes. All of them looked on the man made of clay that lay motionless on the ground. And when Allah asked, "Well, how do you like this man?" the fishes began by saying, "It's a very, very strange thing!" "Is that a man?' cried the birds in amazement. "It's nothing but a piece of clay!" "Yes, that's all it is just a piece of clay!" the four-footed beasts cried, too. "And you, my messenger, what do you think of this man?" Allah asked the white crow. "I say that it has a wonderful shape," answered the crow, "but . . ." "What else do you want to say?" asked Allah. "Only this: there is no life in the man," the crow said at last. "There shall indeed be life in the man," Allah said then. "And I not only wish to give him life, I want to make him immortal. Therefore I am sending you, my messenger, this very day to bring me the life-water from the fountain of life, that shall make man immortal." "And in what shall I fetch the water?" asked the white crow. "Will one beak-full be enough to make the man immortal?" "No," Allah replied. "You must fetch the water in the big vessel that you will find beside the fountain of life. And remember this: do not let any other animal drink of the water, because I want man alone to be immortal. Promise me that you will not drink any of it, either." "I promise," said the white crow, and she flew away to fetch the life-giving water. The fountain of life was far away, and the white crow became tired and thirsty. After she filled the vessel and had flown part of the way back, she had a great desire to drink just a few drops of the water. "Allah will never be able to see that there are a few drops missing," she reasoned to herself. "And why shouldn't I slake my thirst with the water? Then I shall be immortal, too." So thought the white crow. And the more she thought about it, the more she longed for immortality. Finally she drank a few drops . . . and then a few more . . . and, at last, she had almost emptied the vessel. "Is that the vessel full of life-water that you were to bring me?" asked Allah, when he saw the few drops that still remained in it. "With these few drops I can give man life, but I cannot make him immortal. Why were you unable to fill the vessel, my messenger?" "There was no more life-water in the fountain/' lied the white crow. At that moment a magpie, whose feathers also were a beautiful white, flew to Allah, and cried, "The white crow lies, Lord; she herself drank of the life-water that was in the jar. I sat in a tree along the way and I saw her drinking/' When Allah heard this, he was so angry at the white crow that he took her beautiful white feathers from her and in place of them gave her black ones. And when the black-feathered crow stood before him with her head bowed in shame, Allah spoke to her and to the magpie, "I expel you both from Paradise. You, crow, because you drank the life-water and then lied about it. And you, magpie, because you were a spy and a talebearer, I will take away half of your white feathers and, even as the crow, you shall have black ones in their place!" That is why the magpie has black-and-white feathers, and the crow is entirely black. But whether or not the life-water made the crow immortal the story does not tell. </a>

The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.​</a>

Once upon a time, there were two mice â cousins. One lived in the town and the other in the country. The town mouse was a very superior mouse, who thought that living in the town was far better than living the country. So one day, he invited his country cousin to stay with him in his town house and experience the civilized lifestyle of the town. They sat down to a meal, which to the country mouse was a feast. âGoodness meâ he said. âIf I was in the country, I would be having only simple bread and cheese in the quiet of my peaceful home.â Suddenly, there was a loud noise at the door. âDonât worry,â said the town mouse, âthatâs just my neighbour - the dog, he wants to join us for dinner.â The country mouse ate a little faster. Another noise was heard outside, even louder this time. âOh dearâ said the town mouse, âthe cat who lives facing my house wants to join us too.â Quickly eating the last of his meal, the country mouse said, âthank you, but I think I will return to the peace and quiet of my own house after all!â Then he ran back home as fast as his legs could carry him.

Selanjutnya saya berfoto dengan musisi musik tradisional.Adik saya, sepupu saya dan keponakan saya menikmati pemandangan pengunjung lain. Mereka berfoto dengan gaya mereka seperti saya. Sore harinya, kami kembali ke rumah. Serta melakukan aktivitas privat lainnya, seperti bercakap-cakap, bercerita dan bercanda.Lusa, sepupu saya mengadakan upacara untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada Tuhan karena telah memberkati putra mereka. Itu disebut "Nazar". Ketika orang tua memiliki janji untuk sesuatu dan itu terwujud. Mereka harus membuat upacara adat. Saya menyaksikan upacara adat itu dan mengambil foto mereka.Untuk pertunjukan terakhir, kami dihibur oleh “Ebeg”. Itu adalah seni tradisional. Pemain menari melalui musik tradisional dan ditangani oleh roh. Itu menakutkan, tapi menyenangkan dan menghibur.Waktu berjalan sangat cepat karena keesokan harinya adalah hari terakhir kami di desa. Jadi saya mengambil foto terakhir untuk dibawa pulang. Mereka adalah keluargaku dan masih keluargaku sampai nafas terakhir di dunia ini.Akhirnya kami harus pulang dan membawa pengalaman cinta dari keluarga. Yaps… itu bagian tersulit.Soal:1.Temukan 10 kalimat dengan bentuk puluhan lampau sederhana dari teksjawab yg bener!  kak ​</a>

THE QUEEN'S Necklace
once there was a queen. she went to take a bath, took of her necklace and hung it on a hook. a crow came and flew off with the necklace. when the bird found out that the necklace was not edible, he dropped it down. the necklace feel from the sky and dropped into a tree. under that tree, there is a flowing river in which all the dirt of the city was floating. very dirty. when the queen came out of her bath, she saw that the necklace was missing. she cried. “a thief has taken mu necklace!” was that crow a real thief? she never knew, but still she said, “a thief has taken my necklace and i won’t eat any food until i get it back.” now, nobody could find the necklace and the king offered that whoever would find that necklace and bring it to him, he would give a half of his kingdom.
some travellers were going by and they stopped under that tree to take some shelter and looked into that dirty river. “oh there’s the necklace,” they cried, “now let us jump into the water and take it out.” so they jumped into the river and swam deep, but they could not get anything. they came out again and saw the necklace was there. so again, they jumped in and came out from the river. everytime they came out they still saw it. so they thought, “that thief is very clever. whenever we come out he shows us the necklace but when we jump in he takes and hides it. he is very clever.”
after some time a huge crowd gathered, the king was passing and said, “what’s the matter, why are so many people there by that river?” the people said, “there is the necklace, king. the king said, “yes that is the necklace, i should go and jump to take it.” but his prime minister said, “ok king. i’m going to jump in and get this necklace for you.” then the king thought, “if the prime minister gets the necklace for me, then a half of the kingdom will be his, so why should i lose my kingdom? these clothes are very fine, but they are not as expensive as half of the kingdom.” see, the king was very cunning. “i will jump in to the water,” he said. so he jumped into that dirty river with all his clothes on. he searched all around but he could not get that necklace. he came out and said, “well, the necklace there as soon as i jump in it disappears. why should this be?”
just then a guru, a man who knew a lot of knowledge, was passing by and he said, “this is neither a fasting day nor a holy day. what’s the matter. why are so many people gathered around here?” and they said, “sir, that’s the matter. the necklace is there and we went to take it out.” he said, “can’t you find it in the water?” they said, “no.” he said, “ok wait.”
then he climbed the tree, took the necklace down and get it to the king. in fact, the necklace in the river was not the real one. it was up there all the time but they could only see the reflection.</a>

                            2. mengapa pada kalimat "when _____ you started playing the guitar?" jawabannya harus pake "did", bukan memakai "were" padahal jawabannya "when I was about eight" ?</h2><br />
                        Jawabannya benar memakai did, <br />sehingga kalimatnya menjadi "When DID you START playing the guitar?" <br /><br />(seharusnya jika sudah ada kata DID maka kata kerja berikutnya harus dlm bentuk Verb1)<br />.<br />.<br />Mengapa tidak memakai WERE? <br />Sekilas kalimat tersebut kelihatannya termasuk ke dalam kelompok kalimat Past Continuous Tense, tetapi kata kerja yang pertama ditulis adalah "START" bukan "PLAYING", maka tobenya harus memakai DID bukan WERE<br />(were dipakai jika kata kerja yang pertama ditulis adalah kata kerja yang berakhiran -ing seperti playing)<br />

The clever judge
Hello, friends! How is life today? I'm very well, thankyou. Well friends, have you ever heard the story of the " The Clever Judge ", that is the story of a fox and two donkeys? Okay, I am not sure. Maybe, most of us haven't heard the story of the clever judge from our parents or grand parents, well friends, now I would like to tell you about it. Listen to me. Once a lion, a fox, and a donkey set off for day's hunting, after agreeing that each was to have an equal share what was caught.
After a time, they were able to pull down an kill a fat buck, and the lion asked the donkey to be so good as to divide the prize. As fairly as he could, the obliging donkey cut up the buck into three equal parts, and then he invited the lion to take his choice. At this, the lion flew into a violent rage, sptang on the poor donkey and killed him with a powerful blow. Then the lion told the fox to divide the meat. This the fox did, but he was cunning. He put aside a big heap for the lion's share, and kept only a small piece for himself. On seeing this, the lion looked very pleased. " Master fox" he said, this is indeed a most satisfactory divisor. Who taught you to be so clever? ' The dead donkey has been my teacher' replied the fox. " From his foolish conduct I have learned to be wise "
Okay friends, I think that's all for now. And thank you very much for your attention. Goodbye</h2><br />
                        Hakim Pintar<br />Halo teman-teman! Bagaimana kehidupan hari ini? Saya sangat baik terima kasih. Nah teman-teman, apakah Anda pernah mendengar cerita tentang "Pintar Hakim", yang isinya adalah kisah rubah dan dua keledai? Oke, saya tidak yakin. Mungkin, sebagian besar dari kita belum mendengar cerita tentang hakim yang cerdas dari orang tua kita atau nenek kakek kita, baik teman-teman, sekarang saya ingin memberitahu Anda tentang hal itu. Dengarkan aku. Setelah singa, rubah, dan seekor keledai berangkat untuk berburu, setelah setuju bahwa masing-masing memiliki bagian yang sama apa yang tertangkap. Setelah beberapa saat, mereka mampu membunuh banteng besar, dan singa meminta keledai menjadi begitu baik untuk membagi hadiah. Seadil mungkin, keledai mewajibkan memotong daging menjadi tiga bagian yang sama, dan kemudian ia mengundang singa untuk mengambil pilihannya. Pada saat ini, singa sedang marah dan menggunakan kekuatannya, pada keledai miskin dan membunuhnya dengan pukulan kuat. Kemudian singa mengatakan rubah untuk membagi daging. rubah melakukan, tapi ia licik. Dia menyisihkan tumpukan besar bagi bagian terbesar, dan terus hanya sepotong kecil untuk dirinya sendiri. Melihat hal ini, singa tampak sangat senang. "Guru rubah" katanya, ini memang yang paling memuaskan pembagi. Siapa yang mengajari Anda menjadi begitu pintar? 'keledai yang mati telah menjadi guru saya "jawab rubah. "Dari perilaku bodoh, aku telah belajar untuk menjadi bijaksana"teman baik-baik saja, saya pikir itu semua untuk saat ini. Dan terima kasih banyak atas perhatian Anda. Selamat tinggal<br /><br />

Last month i did PSG . i took a practice at a clinic . i learned so many new thing. i learned about nursing science , how to interact well , maintain behavior and ethics.
daily habits change, such as injecting drugs, giving drugs, helping calm patients, and more
there is very much experience and learning that I got from there. and maybe I'll just tell you one experience.
I'm not afraid or disgusted with blood, vomiting, and feces. and when one day I was given permission to witness the hectic process in the head area.
I was dizzy, nauseous, my knees were limp I wanted to get out of the room but I quickly changed my mindset when I saw the hectic process.
I think all this is for learning, we should know because we are in the health sector.
and from there all the symptoms disappeared.
mohon koreksinya</h2><br />

                            14. The Legend of Surabaya    A long time ago in East Java there were two strong animals, Sura and Baya. Sura was a shark and Baya was a crocodile. They lived in the sea. Actually, they were friends. But when they were hungry, they were very greedy. They did not want to share their food. They would fight for it and never stop fighting until one of them gave up.    It was a very hot day. Sura and Baya were looking for some food. Suddenly, Baya saw a goat. “Yummy, this is my lunch,” said Baya. “No way! This is my lunch. You are greedy! I had not eaten for two days!” said Sura. ThenThen Sura and Baya fought again. After several hours, they were very tired. Sura had a plan to stop their bad behavior. “I’m tired of fighting, Baya,” said Sura. “Yes, I do. Let’s share our territory. I live in the water, so I look for food in the sea. And you live on the land, right? So, you look for the food also on the land. The border is the beach, so we will never meet again. Do you agree?” asked Sura. “Hmm... let me think about it. OK, I agree. From today, I will never go to the sea again. My place is on the land,” said Baya. ThenThen they both lived in the different places.

IN THE OLDEN DAYS, when the tigers still lived in peace with other animals, the crow was called "The Bird of Paradise." Her feathers were of purest white; but since then she has lost these beautiful white feathers and in their place wears black ones. How this came about is told in a very old tale: When Allah had shaped the fishes, the birds, and the four-footed beasts, he called the white crow to him and said, "Bird of Paradise, you are large and handsome, you are strong and swift; therefore you shall be my messenger." The crow bowed her sleek white head and said, "Great Allah, I will be your messenger. Tell me what you wish me to do. Allah showed the white crow a bit of clay, and said, "From this clay I am going to knead a man." So Allah kneaded a man, and when he had laid the figure near him on the ground he called the animals to admire it. All of them came the birds, the four-footed beasts, and the fishes. All of them looked on the man made of clay that lay motionless on the ground. And when Allah asked, "Well, how do you like this man?" the fishes began by saying, "It's a very, very strange thing!" "Is that a man?' cried the birds in amazement. "It's nothing but a piece of clay!" "Yes, that's all it is just a piece of clay!" the four-footed beasts cried, too. "And you, my messenger, what do you think of this man?" Allah asked the white crow. "I say that it has a wonderful shape," answered the crow, "but . . ." "What else do you want to say?" asked Allah. "Only this: there is no life in the man," the crow said at last. "There shall indeed be life in the man," Allah said then. "And I not only wish to give him life, I want to make him immortal. Therefore I am sending you, my messenger, this very day to bring me the life-water from the fountain of life, that shall make man immortal." "And in what shall I fetch the water?" asked the white crow. "Will one beak-full be enough to make the man immortal?" "No," Allah replied. "You must fetch the water in the big vessel that you will find beside the fountain of life. And remember this: do not let any other animal drink of the water, because I want man alone to be immortal. Promise me that you will not drink any of it, either." "I promise," said the white crow, and she flew away to fetch the life-giving water. The fountain of life was far away, and the white crow became tired and thirsty. After she filled the vessel and had flown part of the way back, she had a great desire to drink just a few drops of the water. "Allah will never be able to see that there are a few drops missing," she reasoned to herself. "And why shouldn't I slake my thirst with the water? Then I shall be immortal, too." So thought the white crow. And the more she thought about it, the more she longed for immortality. Finally she drank a few drops . . . and then a few more . . . and, at last, she had almost emptied the vessel. "Is that the vessel full of life-water that you were to bring me?" asked Allah, when he saw the few drops that still remained in it. "With these few drops I can give man life, but I cannot make him immortal. Why were you unable to fill the vessel, my messenger?" "There was no more life-water in the fountain/' lied the white crow. At that moment a magpie, whose feathers also were a beautiful white, flew to Allah, and cried, "The white crow lies, Lord; she herself drank of the life-water that was in the jar. I sat in a tree along the way and I saw her drinking/' When Allah heard this, he was so angry at the white crow that he took her beautiful white feathers from her and in place of them gave her black ones. And when the black-feathered crow stood before him with her head bowed in shame, Allah spoke to her and to the magpie, "I expel you both from Paradise. You, crow, because you drank the life-water and then lied about it. And you, magpie, because you were a spy and a talebearer, I will take away half of your white feathers and, even as the crow, you shall have black ones in their place!" That is why the magpie has black-and-white feathers, and the crow is entirely black. But whether or not the life-water made the crow immortal the story does not tell. </h2><br />
                        jadi ceritanya,zaman dahulu kala,burung gagak dikenal dengan sebutan burung surga.Bulunya adalah yang paling indah,putih bersih.Tapi sesudah itu,ia kehilangan bulu indah itu dan diganti dengan bulu hitam. Hal ini terjadi karena ketika Allah menciptakan  gagak,ia memuji gagak dan memposisikan gagak secara istimewa,yaitu menjadi pesuruh Allah.Lalu,Allah membentuk manusia dari segumpal tanah liat dan Allah mengumpulkan hewan hewan untuk mengagumi manusia tsb.Ternyata,hewan hewan malah menghina manusia tsb.Terakhir,burung gagak mengomentari dan berkata bahwa bentuk manusia ini bagus.Burung gagak disuruh mengambil air hidup dari mata air,ia dan hewan lain tidak diizinkan meminum air tsb karena Allah ingin manusia saja yang memiliki hidup abadi.Setibanya disana,gagak mengambil airnya tetapi ia kehausan dan melanggar janjinya dengan meminum air tsb.Akhirnya,dari tempat air tsb hanya tersisa sedikit.Lalu sekembalinya gagak,ia ditanyai oleh Allah "dengan air sebanyak ini,memang dapat menghidupkan manusia.Tetapi tidak cukup untuk membuatnya hidup abadi" lalu elang berbohong dengan mengatakan bahwa air di mata air telah habis.Tiba-tiba muncullah burung pica pica yang sama indahnya,bulunya berwarna putih dan menyatakan bahwa gagak telah berbohong.Ia menyaksikannya sendiri ketika sedang bertengger dipohon.Gagak pun tertunduk malu.Akhirnya Allah marah,lalu menghukum dengan mengganti separuh dari bulu putih pica pica mnejadi hitam karena ia telah memata-matai,dan gagak keseluruhan bulunya diganti hitam.Inilah asal usul mengapa burung pica pica berwarna setengah hitam setengah putih dan gagak berwarna hitam.Sedangkan di cerita ini tidak dijelaskan mengapa gagak tidak jadi hidup abadi.

However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.​</h2><br />

Once upon a time, there were two mice â cousins. One lived in the town and the other in the country. The town mouse was a very superior mouse, who thought that living in the town was far better than living the country. So one day, he invited his country cousin to stay with him in his town house and experience the civilized lifestyle of the town. They sat down to a meal, which to the country mouse was a feast. âGoodness meâ he said. âIf I was in the country, I would be having only simple bread and cheese in the quiet of my peaceful home.â Suddenly, there was a loud noise at the door. âDonât worry,â said the town mouse, âthatâs just my neighbour - the dog, he wants to join us for dinner.â The country mouse ate a little faster. Another noise was heard outside, even louder this time. âOh dearâ said the town mouse, âthe cat who lives facing my house wants to join us too.â Quickly eating the last of his meal, the country mouse said, âthank you, but I think I will return to the peace and quiet of my own house after all!â Then he ran back home as fast as his legs could carry him.

THE QUEEN'S Necklace
once there was a queen. she went to take a bath, took of her necklace and hung it on a hook. a crow came and flew off with the necklace. when the bird found out that the necklace was not edible, he dropped it down. the necklace feel from the sky and dropped into a tree. under that tree, there is a flowing river in which all the dirt of the city was floating. very dirty. when the queen came out of her bath, she saw that the necklace was missing. she cried. “a thief has taken mu necklace!” was that crow a real thief? she never knew, but still she said, “a thief has taken my necklace and i won’t eat any food until i get it back.” now, nobody could find the necklace and the king offered that whoever would find that necklace and bring it to him, he would give a half of his kingdom.
some travellers were going by and they stopped under that tree to take some shelter and looked into that dirty river. “oh there’s the necklace,” they cried, “now let us jump into the water and take it out.” so they jumped into the river and swam deep, but they could not get anything. they came out again and saw the necklace was there. so again, they jumped in and came out from the river. everytime they came out they still saw it. so they thought, “that thief is very clever. whenever we come out he shows us the necklace but when we jump in he takes and hides it. he is very clever.”
after some time a huge crowd gathered, the king was passing and said, “what’s the matter, why are so many people there by that river?” the people said, “there is the necklace, king. the king said, “yes that is the necklace, i should go and jump to take it.” but his prime minister said, “ok king. i’m going to jump in and get this necklace for you.” then the king thought, “if the prime minister gets the necklace for me, then a half of the kingdom will be his, so why should i lose my kingdom? these clothes are very fine, but they are not as expensive as half of the kingdom.” see, the king was very cunning. “i will jump in to the water,” he said. so he jumped into that dirty river with all his clothes on. he searched all around but he could not get that necklace. he came out and said, “well, the necklace there as soon as i jump in it disappears. why should this be?”
just then a guru, a man who knew a lot of knowledge, was passing by and he said, “this is neither a fasting day nor a holy day. what’s the matter. why are so many people gathered around here?” and they said, “sir, that’s the matter. the necklace is there and we went to take it out.” he said, “can’t you find it in the water?” they said, “no.” he said, “ok wait.”
then he climbed the tree, took the necklace down and get it to the king. in fact, the necklace in the river was not the real one. it was up there all the time but they could only see the reflection.</h2><br />
                        Kalung RATU<br />Suatu hari ada seorang ratu. Dia pergi untuk mandi, melepaskan kalugnya dan menggantungnya di gantungan. Seekor gagak datang dan pergi membawa kalugnya. Ketika gagak itu tahu bahwa kalung itu tidak bisa dimakan, a menjatuhkannya. Kalung itu jatuh dari langit dan jatuh ke atas pohon. Di bawah pohon itu, ada sungai yang mengalir dimana kotoran dari kota mengapung. Sangat kotor. Ketika ratu selesai mandi, dia melihat bahwa kalungnya hilang. Dia menangis. "Seorang pencuri sudah mengambil kalungku!" Apakah gagak itu pencuri asli? Ratu tidak pernah tahu, tetapi ia tetap berkata "Seorang pencuri telah mengambil kalungku dan aku tidak akan makan sampai aku mendapatkannya kembali." Sekarang tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat menemukan kalung itu dan raja menawarkan jika siapapun menemukan kalung itu dan membawanya kepada raja, ia akan memberi setengah dari kerajaannya.<br /><br />Beberapa wisatawan mampir dan mereka berhenti di bawah pohon itu untuk mendapatkan perlindungan dan melihat ke dalam sungai itu. "Oh, itu kalungnya," Mereka berteriak, "Sekarang ayo kita melompat ke dalam sungai dan membawany keluar." Jadi mereka melompat ke  dalam sungai dan berenang dalam-dalam, tapi mereka tidak bisa mendapatkan apapun. Mereka keluar lagi dan melihat bahwa kalung itu ada di situ.  Jadi, mereka melompat ke dalam dan keluar dari sungai. Setiap kali mereka keluar kalung itu masih ada di situ. Jadi mereka berpikir, "Pencuri itu sangat pintar.Ketika kita keluar dia menunjukkan kalungnya tetapi ketika kita melompat ke dalam dia mengambilnya dan menyembunyikannya. Dia sangat pintar."<br /><br />Setelah beberapa waktu sebuah keremunan besar berkumpul, raja lewat dan berkata, "Ada apa, mengapa ada banyak orang di sungai itu?" Orang-rang berkata, "Ada kalung itu Raja." Raja berkata, "Ya, itu kalungny, aku harus pergi dan melompat untuk mengambilnya." Tetapi perdana menterinya berkata, "Baik raja. Saya akan melompat ke dalam dan mengambilkannya untukmu," Kemudian raja berpikir, "Jika perdana menteriku mengambilkan kalung itu untukku, setengah dari kerajaan akan menjadi miliknya, jadi mengapa aku harus kehilangan kerajaanku? Pakaian ini sangat bagus, tetapi mereka tidak semahal setengah dari kerajaan." Lihat, Raja sangat lihai. "Aku akan melompat ke dalam sungai," katanya. Jadi ia melompat ke dalam sungai kotor itu dengan mengenakan pakaiannya. Dia mencari kesana-kemari tetapi dia tidak dapat mendapatkan kalung itu. Dia keluar dan berkata, "Segera setelah saya melompat kalung itu hilang. Mengapa seperti ini?"<br /><br />Saat itu seorang ahli, seorang laki-laki yang berwawasan luas lewat dan berkata, "Ini bukan hari puasa maupun hari raya. Apa yang terjadi? Mengapa banyak orang berkumpul di sini?" Dan mereka berkata, "Tuan, itu masalahnya. Kalung itu ada disitu dan kami pergi untuk mengambilnya."  Ia berkata,  "Tidak bisakah kamu menemukannya di air?" Mereka menjawab, "Tidak." Lalu ia berkata "Baiklah, tunggu."<br /><br />Kemudian, ia memanjat pohon, mengambil kalung itu dan membawanya kepada Raja. Sebenarnya, kalung yang di sungai itu palsu. Kalung itu ada di atas pohon selama ini, tetapi mereka hanya melihat bayangannya.<br />
