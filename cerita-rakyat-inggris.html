                            3. cerita rakyat dalam bahasa inggris​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Malin Kundang</p><p>Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”</p><p></p><p>In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.</p><p></p><p>It had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet. Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.</p><p></p><p>After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.</p><p>            <strong>Sangkuriang.</strong>                       Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p></p><p>They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p></p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p></p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p></p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />

                        Cindelaras Story<br /><br />This story had been handed down from generation to generation among the Javanese people in Indonesia for hundred of years or maybe a thousand  years.   The setting is Kediri, east Java in the 11th century.  I heard this story from my mother when I was a kid.  Now I have told this story to my three daughters.  This is the story.<br /><br />Long time ago in the island of Java there was a kingdom of Kediri.  The king was Raden Putra.  He was a rich and powerful king.  He liked cock fighting.  One of his wives told him that the queen had put poison in his food.  The king was very angry.  Without thinking deeply and without checking this information,    he immediately ordered his soldiers to bring the queen to a wood and kill her.  Soon the soldiers took her to the wood.  But when they were there the soldiers took a pity on her.  They did not want to kill her because she was a kind and wise queen and at that time she was pregnant.  So they built a house and let the queen live there.  Then they brought back to palace a deer’s heart to show the king that they had killed her.<br /><br />Several months later the queen gave birth to a baby boy.  He was a healthy and handsome boy.  His name was Cinde Laras.  Then he grew up to be a strong and smart boy.  He liked to go to the wood.  One day he found an egg.  He brought it home and then  when it hatched it became a cock.  Like his father,  Cinde Laras like cock fighting.  He often went to neighboring villages to play cock fighting.  His cock was a strong cock so it won all fight.  He became famous.  Everybody in the whole kingdom knew him and his cock.<br /><br />Finally the news of Cinde Laras and his cock reached the king.  He invited Cinde Laras to palace for a cock fight.  So Cinde Laras came to the palace.  In a fight his cock could easily beat the king’s cock.  Everybody was surprised.  They were even more surprised when Cinde Laras’ cock crowed.  It was a strange crow.<br /><br />‘Cockledodo,  I am the cock of Cinde Laras, who lived in the wood, the son of Raden Putra’.<br /><br />The king was very surprised.  He questioned Cinde Laras immediately.  Cinde Laras told him that he was the son of the queen who now lived in the wood.  After that the king went to see the queen in the wood.  She told him that she was a victim of palace politics.<br /><br />The King regretted his unwise decision.  Then he brought them back to palace and he  punished to his evil wife.  Later on Cinde Laras would replace him as the king of Kediri.<br /><br /><br />transleat sendiri tq<br /><br />

                        Hello Hikma19<br /><br />The Legend of Rawa Pening, Salatiga, Central Java<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was a little boy, who was poor, dirty, and smelly, came into a little village. He was very hungry and weak. He knocked at every door and asked for some food, but nobody cared about him. Nobody wanted to help the little boy. Finally, a generous old woman helped him. She gave him shelter and a meal. When the boy wanted to leave, the old woman gave him a “lesung”, a big wooden mortar for pounding rice.<br />She reminded him, “Please remember, if there is a flood you must save yourself. Use this “lesung” as a boat”.<br />The little boy was happy and thanked the old woman. The little boy continued his journey. While he was passing through the village, where he had asked for food, he saw many people gathering on the field. The boy came closer and saw a stick stuck in the ground. People challenged each other to pull out that stick. Everybody tried, but nobody succeeded.<br />“Can I try?” asked the little boy.<br />The crowd laughed mockingly. The boy wanted to try his luck so he stepped forward and pulled out the stick. He could do it very easily. Everybody was dumbfounded. Suddenly, from the hole left by stick, water spouted out. It did not stop until it flooded the village. And no one was saved from the water except the little boy and the generous old woman who gave him shelter and meal. As she told him, he used the “lesung” as a boat and picked up the old woman. The whole village became a huge lake.<br />

                        Kutai Kingdom is a hindu kingdom located in the upper reaches of Mahakam River, East Kalimantan. The main news source of this kingdom is 7 pieces of slate called yupa. The inscription is written in Sanskrit Pallawa, presumably in AD 400 (5th century CE). On one of the inscriptions mentioned, King Kutai who ruled was Mulawarman, Aswawarman's son, grandson of Kudungga. Based on Prof.'s analysis Dr. Purbacaraka, Kudungga is the original name of Indonesia. Thus, when Kudungga ruled, it was suspected that cultural influences from India had not yet come. However, by the time Aswawarman began to rule apparently Hindu influence began to come. Evident in one of the inscriptions found, Aswawarman called Wangsakarta which is the Sanskrit language of India. Wangsakarta means the forming of the family. The ancient heritage of Kutai Kingdom written in Pallawa and Sanskrit gives a hint that there are some Kutai inhabitants living in an Indian civilization. Sanskrit is not the language of ordinary folk, but is commonly used by brahmins. The possibility of Kutai in Sanskrit is used by brahmins. Thus, brahmans may also have been a particular group of people in Kutai. Another group of people emerging from the influence of Indian culture is a group of knights. In Kutai, a group of knights consists of relatives of Mulawarman or limited to people closely related to the king. Communities outside the brahmin and knight groups are still living in the original atmosphere and traditions of Kutai ancestors. There is not much information about the economic activities of the people in the Kingdom of Kutai. However, it is estimated that they live from crops and livestock. The likelihood of living from agricultural products is based on the location of the Kutai Kingdom also inland of Kalimatan and near the flow of the Mahakam River. Livestock life is also a mainstay of their lives given the frequent kings held a sacrifice ceremony. For example, the king once awarded 20,000 head of cattle to the brahmins. In the Kingdom of Kutai is often also performed Asmawedha ceremony or upacarapelepasan horse to determine the boundaries of the kingdom.<br /><br />terjemahan =<br />Kerajaan Kutai merupakan kerajaan hindu yang terletak di hulu Sungai Mahakam, Kalimantan Timur.Sumber berita utama dari kerajaan ini yaitu7 buah batu tulis yang disebut yupa.Prasasti ditulis dengan huruf Pallawa berbahasa Sanskerta, diperkirakan pada tahun 400 M (abad ke-5 M).Pada salah satu prasasti yang ditemukandisebutkan bahwa Raja Kutai yang memerintah adalah Mulawarman, anak Aswawarman, cucu Kudungga.Berdasarkan analisis Prof.Dr.Purbacaraka, Kudungga adalah nama asli Indonesia.Dengan demikian, pada saat Kudungga memerintah, diduga pengaruh kebudayaan dari India belum datang.Namun, pada saat Aswawarman mulai memerintah tampaknya pengaruh Hindu mulai datang.Terbukti pada salah satu prasasti yang ditemukan, Aswawarman disebut Wangsakarta yang merupakan bahasa Sanskerta dari India.Wangsakarta berarti pembentuk keluarga.Prasasti peninggalan Kerajaan Kutai yang ditulis menggunakan huruf Pallawa dan dalam bahasa Sanskerta memberi petunjuk bahwa ada sebagian penduduk Kutai yang hidup dalam suasana peradaban India.Bahasa Sanskerta bukanlah bahasa rakyat biasa, tetapi biasa digunakan oleh para brahmana.Kemungkinan di Kutai pun bahasa Sanskerta digunakan oleh para brahmana.Dengan demikian, para brahmana kemungkinan juga telah menjadi kelompok masyarakat tertentu di Kutai.Kelompok masyarakat lain yang muncul akibat pengaruh kebudayaan India adalah kelompok ksatria.Di Kutai, kelompok ksatria terdiri atas kerabat Mulawarman atau terbatas pada orang-orang yang erat hubungannya dengan raja.Masyarakat di luar kelompok brahmana dan ksatria masih hidup dalam suasana dan tradisi asli nenek moyang masyarakat Kutai.Tidak begitu banyak keterangan yang didapat mengenai kegiatan ekonomi masyarakat di Kerajaan Kutai.Namun, diperkirakan mereka hidup dari hasil pertanian dan peternakan.Kemungkinan hidup dari hasil pertanian didasarkan pada letak Kerajaan Kutai juga beradadi pedalaman Kalimatan dan dekat aliran Sungai Mahakam.Kehidupan peternakan juga menjadi andalan hidup mereka mengingat seringnya raja mengadakan upacara persembahan.Misalnya, raja pernah menghadiahkan 20.000 ekor sapi kepada para brahmana.Di Kerajaan Kutai sering juga dilakukan upacara Asmawedha atau upacarapelepasan kuda untuk menentukan batas-batas wilayah kerajaan.<br />

                        Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).<br /><br /><br />

                        Mouse Deer and Crocodile<br />One day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.<br />In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”<br />“Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.***<br /><br />

Tapi ia tahu bahwa buaya mungkin menunggu didalam air untuk memakannya, jadi dia berteriak keras-keras. “Aku ingin tahu apakah air hangat. Aku akan memasukkan kaki saya ke dalam air dan mencari tahu. “Tentu saja Kancil memasukkan kakinya. Dia mengambil tongkat dan memasukkan satu ujung ke dalam air. Chomp …!

Kancil tidak mau dimakan oleh buaya ketika ia melintasi sungai. Dia punya ide. Ia berseru keras, “Buaya!” Buaya terangkat dari air, “Halo, Kancil. Apakah kamu datang untuk menjadi makan siang saya? “Kancil tersenyum. “Maaf, tidak hari ini, Buaya. Saya mendapat perintah dari Raja. Dia ingin mengajak seluruh buaya di sungai ini ke pesta. Dia ingin aku menghitung semua buaya sehingga ia bisa mempersiapkan cukup makanan untuk kamu. ”<br />“Sunggu…? Beritahu kami apa yang harus dilakukan, “kata Buaya. “kamu harus berbaris dari sisi sungai ke sisi lain,” kata Kancil.
