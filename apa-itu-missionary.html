Considered one of the 20th Century's greatest humanitarians, she was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016.Who Was Mother Teresa?Nun and missionary Mother Teresa, known in the Catholic church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, devoted her life to caring for the sick and poor. Born in Macedonia to parents of Albanian-descent and having taught in India for 17 years, Mother Teresa experienced her "call within a call" in 1946. Her order established a hospice; centers for the blind, aged and disabled; and a leper colony. In 1979 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. She died in September 1997 and was beatified in October 2003. In December 2015, Pope Francis recognized a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized on September 4, 2016.Where Was Mother Teresa Born?Mother Teresa was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia. The following day, she was baptized as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu.When Did Mother Teresa Die?After several years of deteriorating health, including heart, lung and kidney problems, Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87.Mother Teresa’s Family and Young LifeMother Teresa’s parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, were of Albanian descent; her father was an entrepreneur who worked as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. The Bojaxhius were a devoutly Catholic family, and Nikola was deeply involved in the local church as well as in city politics as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence.In 1919, when Mother Teresa — then Agnes — was only eight years old, her father suddenly fell ill and died. While the cause of his death remains unknown, many have speculated that political enemies poisoned him.In the aftermath of her father's death, Agnes became extraordinarily close to her mother, a pious and compassionate woman who instilled in her daughter a deep commitment to charity. Although by no means wealthy, Drana Bojaxhiu extended an open invitation to the city's destitute to dine with her family. "My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others," she counseled her daughter. When Agnes asked who the people eating with them were, her mother uniformly responded, "Some of them are our relations, but all of them are our people."==============================================================================Singaporean salon manager jailed for abusing Myanmar maidSingapore   /   Mon, February 11, 2019 A Singaporean woman who abused her Myanmar maid by forcing her to pour hot water on herself, pulling her hair out and hitting her was jailed for three years on Monday. Singapore is home to almost 250,000 maids, mostly from other parts of Southeast Asia, who head to the tiny but wealthy city-state to earn far higher salaries.The Singapore court heard that Seah was unhappy as she felt her employee was slow in completing her chores.District Judge Olivia Low said that Seah's "unhappiness with the victim’s work should not justify any form of violence against" her.eks on one charge of punching the maid on the forehead. The abuses came to light after the maid accompanied Seah to the salon she managed, where one of the employees alerted the police.Abuse of domestic workers is not as common in tightly-regulated Singapore as other parts of Asia, but some cases have made headlines. In 2017, a Singapore couple were jailed for starving their Philippine maid until she weighed just 29 kilograms=========================================================================================================​</a>

The Advent of Islam In Indonesia: The Indian Theory
C. Gujarat Theories
Marcopolo notes:
“In the [kingdom] Perlak, Muslim traders (Saracen Marchants) are often seen appearing. They had Islamized the natives in the city. At that time, the mountain people lived like animal life, they ate human flesh like animal meat eaten by other animals, dirty or clean not a problem, most importantly they liked it. The most important thing is that they worship the sun.”
According to a report written by Cheng Ho, a Chinese admiral, in 1413 CE (15th century CE), there were already well-dressed Muslims in the north coast of Java, sailors (some of whom have embraced Islam in clean clothes as well, while non-believers looks dirty and rotten). It was later mentioned that in 1400 CE, it was recorded the name of “Mukamad Sakendar Shah” (Arabic name according to Javanese sayings), as the son of the king of Parameswara who was declared as the ruler of Blambangan (East Java). With that name, it appears that he has embraced Islam.
Meanwhile in Sumatra, there has been an Islamic Kingdom called Peureulak (Perlak), as a center for the Islamic patron in the Port of North Sumatra. Historians explain that the advent of Islam to the Peureulak (Perlak) and the northern coasts of Java, occurs through the process of mission sacré, that is the process of preaching by the attitude (bil hal), brought by the muballigh or da'i who also became a trader.
The process was initially carried out individually. They performed the obligations of Islamic shari'a by using clean clothes and maintaining the cleanliness of the body, clothing, home, and houses of worship. In the social life, they show a simple attitude, with good speech and polite, in accordance with the demands of al-akhlaq al-karimah, honest, helpful, especially in participating to give the treatment to the sick. They teach good living, maintenance of cleanliness, respect, helpful, community life, love, nature of plants and animals, understanding the meaning of the surroundings, performing obligations to be done for the sake of the Creator of the universe, doing good deeds, avoiding evil, so that they may enjoy the happiness in the eternal realm of life in the Hereafter (akhirat). 
It can be said that these moments, the term gotong-royong has become ingrained among Indonesian people. Such attitude becomes an attraction for the indigenous population who, at that time, embraced the Hindu/Buddhist reigion. They were attracted to the Muslim personality, so they saw the light of faith in the Muslims which attracted them to Islam. Thus, the rulers assess the teachings of Islam does not disrupt the stability of government, but even strengthen the government and the unity of it. 
Several hisorians say that in 1400 CE, in the countdown to the fall of Majapahit Empire, there were many musims to be found in the northern coast of Java Island. There is also an important artifact in the gravestone of Maulana Maghribi (Malik Ibrahim), namely a number indicating the year of his death which is 1419 CE. This reinforces the opinion that in previous years he has been active in spreading Islam in norhern coast of East Java. 
Thus, one can concludes that Islam has spread in Sumatra and the north coast of Java by the end of the 13th, in the sense of spreading by social groups, whereas the individual da’wa are expected to take place since the 7th CE. By 15th century, Qur'anic lessons can be heard in surau (small mosque) with Islamic religious lessons, including aqa’id (Islamic theology), fiqh (Islamic Yurisprudency), and akhlaq (moral) which shows that the moral teachings of Islam has been given from the early age. The spread of Islam since the 13th century was carried out by traders who came from the coast of Malabar and Karamandel. This lead one to conclude that Islam brought by the traders is Islam that has been spread over these coasts. In Java, especially the north coast, madrasah leaders and Islamic missionary movements are known as wali. The famous association is the wali songo (nine saints), each of whom is called sunan.</a>

                                            Although great natural barriers hindered east-west development in Canada, this circumstance was mitigated by the mighty river and lake systems that provided avenues for the fur trader, missionary, soldier, and settler. Canada's rivers and lakes allowed and, indeed, invited venturesome pioneers to explore the interior of the continent and in spite of natural barriers, to tap its great wealth. The rivers and lakes were essential to the great fur empire; people in canoes brought furs from the farthest extremity of the Canadian Shield to Montreal for exportation to Europe. The first settlements spread along the rivers, since only the rivers provided transportation and communication. Militarily, rivers and lakes were of prime importance; whoever controlled the St. Lawrence and its entrance also controlled Canada.

                                             Albert Schweitzer was born in Kaysersberg, Upper Alsace, Germany (now Haut-Rhin Department, France) on January 14, 1875 into a family that had a long tradition of service in music, religion, scholarship and education. He initially seemed destined for a career in music, even receiving some advanced training in Paris, but later decided to follow the same calling as his father - that of becoming a pastor.
   He was educated in Theology at the University of Strasbourg from 1893, was awarded a doctoral degree in 1899, and was ordained as the curate of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg in 1900. A year later he became an official of the theological seminary of St. Thomas in that city - his own old college. His authorship of "The Quest for the Historical Jesus" (1906) brought him celebrity as a theological scholar. 
   Albert Schweitzer also gained international repute as an accomplished organist and authority on organ construction. His best-known musicological work, Johann Sebastian Bach, was published in French in 1905 and rewritten in German in 1908; an English translation appeared in 1911. In this work he emphasized the religious nature of Bach's music and advocated the simple, undistorted style of performing Bach's works that was accepted afterward as the standard type of presentation.
   Following on from his reading about the medical needs of Africans in the Congo he decided to train in medicine so that he could serve as a medical missionary rather than as a pastor and between 1905-1913 he duly studied medicine and surgery at the University of Strasbourg. 
   He went to Lambaréné, French Equatorial Africa (now in Gabon),  as a medical missionary accompanied by his new wife in 1913 under the aegis of the Paris Missionary Society. He set up a hospital based round an old chicken house where he cared for some 2000 patients during his first year. 
   In 1917-1918 Schweitzer, as a German national, was interned in France but wrote, during this period, two volumes of a projected philosophical study of civilization, The Decay and the Restoration of Civilization and Civilization and Ethics (both 1923; trans. 1923). Concerned in these volumes with ethical thought in history, Schweitzer contended that modern civilization is in decay because it lacks the will to love. He suggested that people should develop a philosophy based on what he termed "reverence for life," embracing with compassion all forms of life. 
   Schweitzer remained in Europe until 1924, when he returned to Lambaréné. In spite of many obstacles, he rebuilt his hospital and equipped it to provide care for thousands of Africans, including 300 lepers. He returned frequently to Europe to lecture and give organ recitals. His performances earnt substantial fees which were used in the building of better facilities at Lambaréné. Much money also flowed in by way of donation.
   In another theological study "The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle" (1930; trans. 1931), he examined the New Testament from the eschatological viewpoint of its reputed authors.
   In 1949 Albert he visited the United States and in 1952 he received the Nobel Peace Prize to add to such other recognitions as the Goethe prize of Frankfurt and numerous honorary doctorates awarded by Universities.
   The monies associated with the Nobel Prize were expended towards the accomodation of persons afflicted with leprosy at Lambaréné.
  In the early 1960's the medical mission at Lambaréné could accomodate some five hundred patients-in-residence.
   Albert Schweitzer died September 4, 1965 and was buried in the grounds of the medical mission to which he had devoted his life. He was ninety years of age at the time and had remained actively involved in the medical mission at Lambaréné for almost fifty years.

The term “primitive art” has been used in a variety of ways to describe works and styles of art. One way that this term has been used is to describe the early period within the development of a certain style of art. Another way that this term has been used is to describe artists who have received little professional training and who demonstrate a non traditional naivete in their work.
A wonderful example of this second type of primitive artist is Grandma Moses, who spent all her life on a farm and working at tasks normally associated with farm life. She did not begin painting until she reached the age of seventy-six, when she switched to painting from embroidery because the arthritis in her hands made embroidery too difficult. Totally without formal education in art, she began creating panoramic image of everybody life on the farm that have achieved international fame.

PASSAGE 6
The first English attempts to colonize North America were controlled by individuals rather than companies. Sir Humphrey Gilbert was the first Englishman to send colonists to the New World. His initial expedition, which sailed in 1578 with a patent granted by Queen Elizabeth 1 was defeated by the Spanish. A second attempt ended in disaster in 1583, when Gilbert and his ship were lost in a storm. In the following year, Gilbert's half brother, Sir Water Raleigh, having obtained a renewal of the patent, sponsored an expedition that explored the coast of the region that he named "Virginia." Under Raleigh's direction efforts were then made to establish a colony on Roanoke island in 1585 an6 1587. The survivors of the first settlement on Roanoke returned to England in 1586, but the second group of colonists disappeared without leaving a trace. The failure of the Gilbert and Raleigh ventures made it clear that the
tasks they had undertaken were too big for any one colonizer. Within a short time the trading company had supplanted the individual promoter of colonization.

TOLONG TRANSLATE KE INDO YA SAYA LAGI SAKITMother Teresa Biography, Saint, Nun (1910–1997)Mother Teresa was the founder of the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to helping the poor. Considered one of the 20th Century's greatest humanitarians, she was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016.Who Was Mother Teresa?Nun and missionary Mother Teresa, known in the Catholic church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, devoted her life to caring for the sick and poor. Born in Macedonia to parents of Albanian-descent and having taught in India for 17 years, Mother Teresa experienced her "call within a call" in 1946. Her order established a hospice; centers for the blind, aged and disabled; and a leper colony. In 1979 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. She died in September 1997 and was beatified in October 2003. In December 2015, Pope Francis recognized a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized on September 4, 2016.Where Was Mother Teresa Born?Mother Teresa was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia. The following day, she was baptized as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu.When Did Mother Teresa Die?After several years of deteriorating health, including heart, lung and kidney problems, Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87.Mother Teresa’s Family and Young LifeMother Teresa’s parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, were of Albanian descent; her father was an entrepreneur who worked as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. The Bojaxhius were a devoutly Catholic family, and Nikola was deeply involved in the local church as well as in city politics as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence.In 1919, when Mother Teresa — then Agnes — was only eight years old, her father suddenly fell ill and died. While the cause of his death remains unknown, many have speculated that political enemies poisoned him.In the aftermath of her father's death, Agnes became extraordinarily close to her mother, a pious and compassionate woman who instilled in her daughter a deep commitment to charity. Although by no means wealthy, Drana Bojaxhiu extended an open invitation to the city's destitute to dine with her family. "My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others," she counseled her daughter. When Agnes asked who the people eating with them were, her mother uniformly responded, "Some of them are our relations, but all of them are our people."==============================================================================Singaporean salon manager jailed for abusing Myanmar maidSingapore   /   Mon, February 11, 2019 A Singaporean woman who abused her Myanmar maid by forcing her to pour hot water on herself, pulling her hair out and hitting her was jailed for three years on Monday.

The Advent of Islam In Indonesia: The Indian Theory
C. Gujarat Theories
Marcopolo notes:
“In the [kingdom] Perlak, Muslim traders (Saracen Marchants) are often seen appearing. They had Islamized the natives in the city. At that time, the mountain people lived like animal life, they ate human flesh like animal meat eaten by other animals, dirty or clean not a problem, most importantly they liked it. The most important thing is that they worship the sun.”
According to a report written by Cheng Ho, a Chinese admiral, in 1413 CE (15th century CE), there were already well-dressed Muslims in the north coast of Java, sailors (some of whom have embraced Islam in clean clothes as well, while non-believers looks dirty and rotten). It was later mentioned that in 1400 CE, it was recorded the name of “Mukamad Sakendar Shah” (Arabic name according to Javanese sayings), as the son of the king of Parameswara who was declared as the ruler of Blambangan (East Java). With that name, it appears that he has embraced Islam.
Meanwhile in Sumatra, there has been an Islamic Kingdom called Peureulak (Perlak), as a center for the Islamic patron in the Port of North Sumatra. Historians explain that the advent of Islam to the Peureulak (Perlak) and the northern coasts of Java, occurs through the process of mission sacré, that is the process of preaching by the attitude (bil hal), brought by the muballigh or da'i who also became a trader.
The process was initially carried out individually. They performed the obligations of Islamic shari'a by using clean clothes and maintaining the cleanliness of the body, clothing, home, and houses of worship. In the social life, they show a simple attitude, with good speech and polite, in accordance with the demands of al-akhlaq al-karimah, honest, helpful, especially in participating to give the treatment to the sick. They teach good living, maintenance of cleanliness, respect, helpful, community life, love, nature of plants and animals, understanding the meaning of the surroundings, performing obligations to be done for the sake of the Creator of the universe, doing good deeds, avoiding evil, so that they may enjoy the happiness in the eternal realm of life in the Hereafter (akhirat). 
It can be said that these moments, the term gotong-royong has become ingrained among Indonesian people. Such attitude becomes an attraction for the indigenous population who, at that time, embraced the Hindu/Buddhist reigion. They were attracted to the Muslim personality, so they saw the light of faith in the Muslims which attracted them to Islam. Thus, the rulers assess the teachings of Islam does not disrupt the stability of government, but even strengthen the government and the unity of it. 
Several hisorians say that in 1400 CE, in the countdown to the fall of Majapahit Empire, there were many musims to be found in the northern coast of Java Island. There is also an important artifact in the gravestone of Maulana Maghribi (Malik Ibrahim), namely a number indicating the year of his death which is 1419 CE. This reinforces the opinion that in previous years he has been active in spreading Islam in norhern coast of East Java. 
Thus, one can concludes that Islam has spread in Sumatra and the north coast of Java by the end of the 13th, in the sense of spreading by social groups, whereas the individual da’wa are expected to take place since the 7th CE. By 15th century, Qur'anic lessons can be heard in surau (small mosque) with Islamic religious lessons, including aqa’id (Islamic theology), fiqh (Islamic Yurisprudency), and akhlaq (moral) which shows that the moral teachings of Islam has been given from the early age. The spread of Islam since the 13th century was carried out by traders who came from the coast of Malabar and Karamandel. This lead one to conclude that Islam brought by the traders is Islam that has been spread over these coasts. In Java, especially the north coast, madrasah leaders and Islamic missionary movements are known as wali. The famous association is the wali songo (nine saints), each of whom is called sunan.</h2><br />

                            8.  Albert Schweitzer was born in Kaysersberg, Upper Alsace, Germany (now Haut-Rhin Department, France) on January 14, 1875 into a family that had a long tradition of service in music, religion, scholarship and education. He initially seemed destined for a career in music, even receiving some advanced training in Paris, but later decided to follow the same calling as his father - that of becoming a pastor.
   He was educated in Theology at the University of Strasbourg from 1893, was awarded a doctoral degree in 1899, and was ordained as the curate of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg in 1900. A year later he became an official of the theological seminary of St. Thomas in that city - his own old college. His authorship of "The Quest for the Historical Jesus" (1906) brought him celebrity as a theological scholar. 
   Albert Schweitzer also gained international repute as an accomplished organist and authority on organ construction. His best-known musicological work, Johann Sebastian Bach, was published in French in 1905 and rewritten in German in 1908; an English translation appeared in 1911. In this work he emphasized the religious nature of Bach's music and advocated the simple, undistorted style of performing Bach's works that was accepted afterward as the standard type of presentation.
   Following on from his reading about the medical needs of Africans in the Congo he decided to train in medicine so that he could serve as a medical missionary rather than as a pastor and between 1905-1913 he duly studied medicine and surgery at the University of Strasbourg. 
   He went to Lambaréné, French Equatorial Africa (now in Gabon),  as a medical missionary accompanied by his new wife in 1913 under the aegis of the Paris Missionary Society. He set up a hospital based round an old chicken house where he cared for some 2000 patients during his first year. 
   In 1917-1918 Schweitzer, as a German national, was interned in France but wrote, during this period, two volumes of a projected philosophical study of civilization, The Decay and the Restoration of Civilization and Civilization and Ethics (both 1923; trans. 1923). Concerned in these volumes with ethical thought in history, Schweitzer contended that modern civilization is in decay because it lacks the will to love. He suggested that people should develop a philosophy based on what he termed "reverence for life," embracing with compassion all forms of life. 
   Schweitzer remained in Europe until 1924, when he returned to Lambaréné. In spite of many obstacles, he rebuilt his hospital and equipped it to provide care for thousands of Africans, including 300 lepers. He returned frequently to Europe to lecture and give organ recitals. His performances earnt substantial fees which were used in the building of better facilities at Lambaréné. Much money also flowed in by way of donation.
   In another theological study "The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle" (1930; trans. 1931), he examined the New Testament from the eschatological viewpoint of its reputed authors.
   In 1949 Albert he visited the United States and in 1952 he received the Nobel Peace Prize to add to such other recognitions as the Goethe prize of Frankfurt and numerous honorary doctorates awarded by Universities.
   The monies associated with the Nobel Prize were expended towards the accomodation of persons afflicted with leprosy at Lambaréné.
  In the early 1960's the medical mission at Lambaréné could accomodate some five hundred patients-in-residence.
   Albert Schweitzer died September 4, 1965 and was buried in the grounds of the medical mission to which he had devoted his life. He was ninety years of age at the time and had remained actively involved in the medical mission at Lambaréné for almost fifty years.

                            10. PASSAGE 5
The term “primitive art” has been used in a variety of ways to describe works and styles of art. One way that this term has been used is to describe the early period within the development of a certain style of art. Another way that this term has been used is to describe artists who have received little professional training and who demonstrate a non traditional naivete in their work.
A wonderful example of this second type of primitive artist is Grandma Moses, who spent all her life on a farm and working at tasks normally associated with farm life. She did not begin painting until she reached the age of seventy-six, when she switched to painting from embroidery because the arthritis in her hands made embroidery too difficult. Totally without formal education in art, she began creating panoramic image of everybody life on the farm that have achieved international fame.

PASSAGE 6
The first English attempts to colonize North America were controlled by individuals rather than companies. Sir Humphrey Gilbert was the first Englishman to send colonists to the New World. His initial expedition, which sailed in 1578 with a patent granted by Queen Elizabeth 1 was defeated by the Spanish. A second attempt ended in disaster in 1583, when Gilbert and his ship were lost in a storm. In the following year, Gilbert's half brother, Sir Water Raleigh, having obtained a renewal of the patent, sponsored an expedition that explored the coast of the region that he named "Virginia." Under Raleigh's direction efforts were then made to establish a colony on Roanoke island in 1585 an6 1587. The survivors of the first settlement on Roanoke returned to England in 1586, but the second group of colonists disappeared without leaving a trace. The failure of the Gilbert and Raleigh ventures made it clear that the
tasks they had undertaken were too big for any one colonizer. Within a short time the trading company had supplanted the individual promoter of colonization.

PASSAGE 7
Although great natural barriers hindered east-west development in Canada, this circumstance was mitigated by the mighty river and lake systems that provided avenues for the fur trader, missionary, soldier, and settler. Canada's rivers and lakes allowed and, indeed, invited venturesome pioneers to explore the interior of the continent and in spite of natural barriers, to tap its great wealth. The rivers and lakes were essential to the great fur empire; people in canoes brought furs from the farthest extremity of the Canadian Shield to Montreal for exportation to Europe. The first settlements spread along the rivers, since only the rivers provided transportation and communication. Militarily, rivers and lakes were of prime importance; whoever controlled the St. Lawrence and its entrance also controlled Canada.
11. What is the main subject of the passage?
(A) The barriers to east-west communication in Canada
(B) The role of rivers and lakes in Canadian development'
(C) The adventures of Canadian settlers
