   I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn't sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mom called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mom called me again. That snooze made me late.
   I did not have time  for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
   I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in may bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
  After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stair. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.

                                            I always get up at 5 am every morning. I press the snooze button three times every morning before I turn off the alarm on my hand phone and wake up. I have a cup of tea and have breakfast. I usually watch television while I have breakfast. My children like to take a bath after they have breakfast but I like to take a bath before I have breakfast. My wife usually brushes her hair and wear a veil. I have short hair so I don’t need to comb my hair.After I have finished work, I go home to have dinner. In my house we usually make dinner. The family eat dinner together at 6:30 pm. After dinner I make sure that my children study and do their homework, and then I relax on the sofa and watch television. On television I usually watch the funny programs. My wife usually comes to tell me to wash the dishes or throw the rubbish. My children feed the cat and hamster before they go to bed and I tell them to go to the bathroom first. If we are sick we have to take our medication. Before sleeping, I always wear my pajamas and set the alarm so I get up early in the morning. The last things I do is locked the gate and the door, check my children and go to bed.Tugas : Temukan adverb of frequency lalu terjemahkan arti dari adverb of frequency tersebut berdasarkan teks di atas?​</a>

                            28. I always get up at 5 am every morning. I press the snooze button three times every morning before I turn off the alarm on my hand phone and wake up. I have a cup of tea and have breakfast. I usually watch television while I have breakfast. My children like to take a bath after they have breakfast but I like to take a bath before I have breakfast. My wife usually brushes her hair and wear a veil. I have short hair so I don’t need to comb my hair.After I have finished work, I go home to have dinner. In my house we usually make dinner. The family eat dinner together at 6:30 pm. After dinner I make sure that my children study and do their homework, and then I relax on the sofa and watch television. On television I usually watch the funny programs. My wife usually comes to tell me to wash the dishes or throw the rubbish. My children feed the cat and hamster before they go to bed and I tell them to go to the bathroom first. If we are sick we have to take our medication. Before sleeping, I always wear my pajamas and set the alarm so I get up early in the morning. The last things I do is locked the gate and the door, check my children and go to bed.Tugas : Temukan adverb of frequency lalu terjemahkan arti dari adverb of frequency tersebut berdasarkan teks di atas?​</h2><br />

 I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mum called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mum called me again. That snooze made me late.
 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
 After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stairs. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.
